# Final Project (Brainstorm)

## Domain of Interest
### Our Interest
Trends in Music
### Why are we interested in this domain?
With the influences of popular culture in our everyday lives, our domain of interest is music. We are interested in the trends within music genres over time as well as where those trends originate from and how they influence social action. Using data from audio streaming platforms, such as Spotify, we hope to create meaningful visualizations of how trends in music develop, evolve, and invoke different behaviors.

### Other Examples of Data Driven Projects
1. Sociologist Steven Stack found that [higher exposure to country music resulted in increased suicidal thoughts and risks](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2938/15e43d8e9a8f96f1205401d6a51c8e095db4.pdf). Stack attributes this to country music themes that foster suicidal ideation such as marital strife and financial struggles. Stack has also studied the affects of blues, metal, and opera on suicide.
2. Silicon Valley Data Science created a [visualization of the history of rock and roll](https://svds.com/rockandroll/) by showing the influences between bands and statistics on 100 songs that represent rock music. Data visualization was done by using [GEPHI](https://gephi.org/) and [D3.JS](http://d3js.org/).
3. The Pudding designed an [interactive Billboard Top 100 visualization](https://pudding.cool/2017/03/music-history/index.html) that plays every #1 song from 1958 to 2016 to show how music taste has evolved over time. Users can toggle between years and search for specific artists.
4. Big Picture Group developed a [Music Timeline visualization](http://research.google.com/bigpicture/music/) to see how different musical genres became popular over time, and discover artists in each genre. The visualization is updated weekly to reflect new music.

### Data Driven Questions
1. What cities are trendsetters or early adopters in music taste? Does this change across genres or years? How do they influence other cities?
2. How do musical themes affect crime? Can we predict crime based on the type of music people listen to? Which genre/theme/beats of music was popular in general when a crime has taken place?
3. How do musical tastes/themes/lyrics change based on current events? eg. Which genre were popular in 2001 after 9/11 attacks?

## Dataset 1
### Where did you download the data?
[From Kaggle: Spotify Tracks Database](https://www.kaggle.com/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db)
### How was the data collected or generated?
This data of Zaheen Hamidani in Kaggle is originally based on Web API generated by Spotify. It consists of audio features and in-depth audio analysis each track in Spotify has. The Spotify Developer Platform team calculated audio features of tracks to learn more about its danceability, tempo, beats, and more to provide more personalized playlists to its users.
### How many observations (rows) are in your data?
228159 observations
### How many features (columns) are in the data?
18 features
### What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
By giving us information on the popularity and styles of tracks, it can help us answer all 3 questions above.

## Dataset 2
### Where did you download the data?
[From Kaggle: Crimes in Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/ankkur13/boston-crime-data)
### How was the data collected or generated?
This dataset from Kaggle contains records on crimes reported in Boston, MA from 2015-2018. It was originally generated by Boston Police Department (BPD). Department of Innovation and Technlogy in BPD gathered data to document initial details surrounding each incident BPD deals with.
### How many observations (rows) are in your data?
2,60,760 observations
### How many features (columns) are in the data?
17 features
### What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
Combined with the Spotify Tracks Database, this dataset can be used to answer question 2 above, as we can see if the music being listened to corresponds with the crimes being committed. For example, if people are listening to songs with themes of robbery at a given time, will we see more thefts during this period?

## Dataset 3
### Where did you download the data?
[From Kaggle: Billboard 1964-2015 Song + Lyrics](https://www.kaggle.com/rakannimer/billboard-lyrics/)
### How was the data collected or generated?
Originally collected by Kaylin Pavlik, which she shared on github. This dataset consists of lyrics from 50 years of Billboard Year-End Hot 100. She first scraped songs and artist names from Wikipedia's entry for each Billboard Year-End chart. She then scraped lyrics from reliable sites and combined the data into one dataset for analysis. it ended up having 5100 observations with features of rank, song, artist, year, lyrics and source.
### How many observations (rows) are in your data?
5100 observations
### How many features (columns) are in the data?
6 features
### What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
This data set can be used to answer question 3 from above by comparing common themes/lyrics in songs corresponding to time and events.
